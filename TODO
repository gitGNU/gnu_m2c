Suggestions from Benjamin Kowarsch:

(1) the mode for lowercase reserved words should be removed
(2) the CAST function of ISO M2 should be added to module SYSTEM
(3) shift and rotate functions should probably be added to module SYSTEM

Remove -upper-case with removal of lower case words. This is implied by 1.

Should -strict be default? If so, extensions should have their own flag.

I prefer POSIX style flags, not -foo or --foo. These should be converted.

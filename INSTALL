Installation in the same directory as one with sources files.
*************************************************************


  1. Run command file `configure' with a single argument which
     specifies the type of system to build the translator for. This
     argument looks as follows:

           CPU


     For example,

       configure vax

     All The possible values of the parameter are given in file
     MACHINES.

     `configure' outputs possible names of C compilers which may be
     used for the Modula-2 translator. After that enter one of the names
     (for example gcc).

     In the case of successful work `configure' in current directory
     generates Makefile (from file `Makefile.tmpl'), file `config.h'
     (from the relative file with suffix `.h' in the subdirectory
     `config') and possibly creates link `m2l_ascor.c' to assembler
     functions which implement Modula-2 coroutines. At the end of
     successful work `configure' write to standard output and file
     `config.status' configuration options were specified.

  2. Install the Modula-2 translator, run-time support and standard
     module library by the following command:

          make install

     This command create all object files and copies the translator
     `m2c' into the directory /usr/local/bin and file `m2c.1' to
     /usr/local/man/man1.  It also copies file `m2lib.a' (run-time
     support) , definition, implementation standard modules and its
     object files into directory /usr/local/lib/m2lib.

     If you wish to copy the files into other directories change
     values of Makefile variables `bindir', `libdir', `man1dir' and
     `prefix'. Use only full path name for the directories! For
     example, if you wish to copy the files into directories
     `/usr/users/VHDL/mak/bin', `/usr/users/VHDL/mak/lib' and
     `/usr/users/VHDL/mak/man/man1' specify

           make install prefix=/usr/users/VHDL/mak
     
                           or

           make install bindir=/usr/users/VHDL/mak/bin\
                libdir=/usr/users/VHDL/mak/lib\
                /usr/users/VHDL/mak/man/man1


Makefile contains following useful entries other than install:

  all       -- creation of all object and executable files;
  
  dist      -- unconditional creation of compressed distribution tar
	       file;

  modclean  -- deletion of object files of standard modules;

  clean     -- deletion of object files of the translator and executable
               file `m2c';

  realclean -- the same as entries `clean', `modclean' and also
               deletion of object files, library of run-time support
               and emacs TAGS table;
               
  TAGS      -- updating TAGS table for the `m2c' sources and run-time
               function sources;

  uninstall -- delete the installed files and empty installation
	       directories.



Installation in directory other than one with sources files.
************************************************************

    If you wish to build the object and executable files in a
subdirectory of the source directory make the same as in previous
sections. `configure' itself find out the sources.


In other case do follows:

  1. Go to that directory before running `configure':

          mkdir m2c-vax; cd m2c-vax

  2. Specify where to find `configure' when you run it:

          ../m2c-0.6/configure ...

  3. Specify where to find the sources, as an argument `+srcdir' to
     `configure':

          ../m2c-0.6/configure +srcdir=../m2c-0.6 vax


Other `configure' options.
**************************

   `configure' ignores following standard GNU options:
    
        `+nfp'     `+gas'     `+x'

   You can use option `+cc' if you wish that configure will not question
about C compiler name. For example,

      configure +cc=gcc vax
